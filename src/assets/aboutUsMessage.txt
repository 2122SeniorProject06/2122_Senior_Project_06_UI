It is so easy to get sucked into focusing on the difficulties of this life; from massive events such as war, poverty, famine, and pestilence to the tiny thing like ordering food, upcoming assignments, and difficult people. As such, itâ€™s difficult to not worry and grow anxious of what the future holds or what the past will reveal.
SHARD was created to help combat anxiety within people. Unlike other apps that solely focus on preventing attacks with long meditation, SHARD focuses on responding to anxiety attacks in the moment, wherever the user may be. SHARD also provides a journaling feature that allows users to reflect on attacks they had or how they prevented one. By putting the events into words, it allows the user to view them in a rational manner to determine cause and future avoidance.
